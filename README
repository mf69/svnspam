Svnspam produces a nicely formatted HTML e-mail message containing the diff,
 log message and versions of files involved in an svn commit. To do this it uses a post-commit hook configured by the Subversion repo admin.

More setup details can be found in the wiki.

This project is a fork of cvsspam ... See the [http://www.badgers-in-foil.co.uk/projects/cvsspam/ CVSspam website] for more information about the origins of this program.

On 2015-04-26 the project migrated from code.google.com to github.
